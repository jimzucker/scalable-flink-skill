scalable-flink-skill: the measurement harness.

This file is the skill's guards, as code. It is shipped with the skill and used
verbatim: an agent following the skill supplies a pipeline (see README.md) and
does NOT rewrite any of this. Every threshold below names the measurement it
was set from, and `prove.py replay` checks each one against the recorded runs
before it is allowed to refuse anything new.

Rules this file implements (one guard per rule; `prove.py selftest` breaks
every one on purpose, because a guard that has never fired is a guess):

  * the resource cap is read back from the container, never from the env var
  * parallelism == cap == allocated slots, all three read back from the engine
  * the job graph shape is read off the running plan and compared across cases
  * the component under test must be the constraint (cap consumption floors)
  * the job is torn down on every exit path, refused cases included
  * the window is anchored on the committed offset advancing, not wall clock
  * throughput comes from the transport (committed broker offsets), not Flink
  * CPU comes from the cumulative cgroup counter, not `docker stats`
  * the backlog must have a full checkpoint interval of headroom at close
  * two vantage points must agree
  * a case's passes spread past the ceiling: that case and its ratios are
    unreportable; the other cases still report

A refusal about the RIG stops the suite. A refusal about one case's DATA marks
that case and moves on.
